Rust HTTP Parser using Nom
==========================

*This is me messing around with Rust and Nom. Don't event think about using
this!*

Stuff left to do:
- [ ] Handle chunked transfer encoding
  - [x] Handle trailing headers
  - [x] Consume chunk params
  - [ ] Expose chunk params
- [ ] Responses
- [ ] Proper error handling
